trojan
======

Home made trojan (c/c++)

I wrote this program for pentesting purpose (work) in 2003. There is few protection against antimalware detection, and it's funny to see that more than ten years later, some antivirus still could not detect it !

There is no documentation at all, and I've lost the webadministration part (oups), so this soft is unusable (and that's why I open this git repository). I'am not sure you can still compile this software.
I've put it online only for educationnal purpose, don't use it for anything else...
